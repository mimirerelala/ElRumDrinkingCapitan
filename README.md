This is our implementation of an AI for Santase card game (66). 
The AI can be tested at http://ai.bgcoder.com

The source code and logic are forked from https://github.com/NikolayIT/SantaseGameEngine

Our code contribution can be found in:
the directory ElRumDrinkingCapitan/SantaseGameEngine-master/Source/AI/mcts/

The logic is NOT complete, and does not yet perform as expected. 
We tried to implement a Monte Carlo tree search method, which implies
searching through all possible game steps, simulating the game to the end, and then choosing the most
profitable step and in the same way reevaluating the situation.
Monte Carlo methods are a common tool in game AI, performing well
in situations withouth perfect information. 

For simulating the game itself we use a knowledge based approach, taking basic
assumptions and simplifications of the game. 

This project was part of a Data Structure and Algorithms Teamwork project in the 2015 edition
of Telerik Academy - free software engineering trainig courses.
